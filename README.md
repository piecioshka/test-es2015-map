> :ledger: Simple test about hashmap with unique keys.

## History

In ECMAScript 5 we have something similar to Python hashmaps called `literal objects`.
That structure could only had unique keys with (only strings) with value (any data).

In ECMAScript 2015 we have a new structure for unique collections called `Map`.
Instance of `Map` has cool API to `get`, `set`, `add`, `has` operations.

In this project I would to show similaries in that two strcutures.
