:ledger: Testing Map from ECMAScript 2015 spec

## History

In ECMAScript 5 we have something similar to Python hashmaps called `literal objects`.
That structure could only had unique keys with (only strings) with value (any data).

In ECMAScript 2015 we have a new structure for unique collections called `Map`.
Instance of `Map` has cool API to `get`, `set`, `add`, `has` operations.

In this project I would like to show similarities in those two structures.
